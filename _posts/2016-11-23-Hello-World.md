I've finally decided to create a blog. I've thought about doing it before, but I've always been too preoccupied with other things, like programming and school. I'm still pretty busy with those things, so why have I decided to start now?

1. I'm having to do a lot more writing for school, and I'm not very good at it. I'm hoping that writing for this blog will give me more practice writing and help me improve.
2. I'm hoping to use this blog to help document my bigger programming projects by blogging about them while I create them. Maybe I'll even get some more exposure for them.
3. It seems like fun!

#### Why did I pick the name My::thoughts()?
I decided to use the name My::thoughts() because this blog is going to be about my thoughts (duh), and I converted it into pseudo-rust.

#### What am I going to write about?
I will be mostly writing about programming and computers, but there will probably be a few posts about my life, world events, and religion.

#### Technical details
In case your interested, here are the technical details about how I'm creating and hosting this blog.

I'm writing this blog as a series of markdown files, which are then transformed by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) into a website. For theming, I'm using [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) since it is lightweight, easy to read, and looks good on mobile. Finally, I'm using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host my website. I am also using Git to version control my blog's source on my computer.

See you soon in the next post!
