    <div class='textholder'>
      <p>My name is Matthew, and I am a sixteen year old Christian boy who loves to read, cook, listen to music, and code. I know Python, HTML/CSS/JS, and Scratch. I have messed around with Java, Proccessing, and F#, but I can't say that I have really learned those.</p>
      <p>I am a proud Tarheel (for those of you who don't know what that means, I live in the state of North Carolina in the United States of America), although sometimes after reading to much news I feel like moving to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a>.</p>
      <p>I love creating art, especially using Acryllic Paint and Colored Pencils. Here are some examples of what I have done in Acryllic and in Colored Pencil </p> <div id="imgholder"><img src="../files/photo_1_cropped.JPG" alt="Acryllic painting of a sunset" class="artimg"><img src="../files/photo_2_cropped.JPG" alt="Colored Pencil drawing of a comet" class="artimg"></div>
      <p>As far as my education goes, I am homeschooled and in the 10th grade. My favorite subject is math. I love math. I like math so much that I've spent ~45 minutes constructing an equation for finding vertex of a parabola from an equation of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c (If you are interested in what that equation is, you can find it <a href="../files/Vertex%20of%20a%20Parabola.pdf">here (PDF)</a></p>
