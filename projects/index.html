      <h2>Scratch NPR</h2>
      <p>Starting in September of 2015, I started working on creating Non-Photorelistic Rendering (NPR) projects in <a href="scratch.mit.edu">Scratch,</a> along with some other Scratchers. I have also worked on a gallery website for us.</p>
      <p>You can find the Scratch NPR Scratch forum thread <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/140162/">here.</a></p>
      <p>You can find the Scratch NPR Scratch studio <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/1440810/">here.</a></p>
      <p>You can find the Scratch NPR website <a href='http://scratchnpr.github.io'>here</a> and <a href='http://scratchnpr.github.io/carousel'>here.</a> (The reason that there are two links is that we are experimenting with two different gallery views.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class='textholder' id='stack'>
      <h2>Stack Programming Language</h2>
      <p>Stack is a stack-based programming language implimented in Python that I created. Here is some example code that checks if the input is a palindrome:</p>
      <pre>'Enter a string' input dup reverse = { 1 } { 0 } ifelse print</pre>
      <p>You can find out more about Stack <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/159218/">here</a></p>
      <p>You can find Stack <a href="https://github.com/BookOwl/stack-lang">on Github</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class='textholder' id='scratchcloud'>
      <h2>Scratch Cloud Services</h2>
      <p>I and several other scratchers have started to create projects that use a node.js server to feed data to a Scratch project, like my <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/85468602/'>live weather project</a>.</p>
      <p>You can find our github <a href='https://github.com/Scratch-Cloud-Services/scratch-cloud-services'>here.</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class='textholder' id='phosphorus'>
      <h2>Phosphorus Linker Userscript</h2>
      <p>I have created a userscript that adds a link to phosphorus to every Scratch project.</p>
      <p>To install, make sure that you have a userscript manager installed in your browser, and then click on <a href='../files/phosphorus-link.user.js'>this link.</a></p>
